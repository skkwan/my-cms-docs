# Gen samples: checking filter efficiencies


From e.g. https://cms-pdmv-prod.web.cern.ch/mcm/requests?page=0&dataset_name=GluGluToHToAA_AToBB_AToTauTau_M25_FilterTauTauTrigger_TuneCP5_13TeV-madgraph-pythia8&prepid=*20UL16wm*

click the first icon in action (edit details), you can look up the filter eff in the gen parameter section

will need to look up for each mass point and year

so for this particular one https://cms-pdmv-prod.web.cern.ch/mcm/requests?prepid=SUS-RunIISummer20UL16wmLHEGEN-00922

filter eff = 0.03215 (first icon)
# events produced after filter = 147,024 (can see by clicking the last camera like icon-- https://dmytro.web.cern.ch/dmytro/cmsprodmon/workflows.php?prep_id=task_SUS-RunIISummer20UL16wmLHEGEN-00922)
