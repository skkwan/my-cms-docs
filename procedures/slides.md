# Slides laundry checklist (non-authoritative)

On each slide: to be done in the slide template:
- Put name, date, and slide number, e.g. at the bottom of the slide in smaller font.
- (Optional) Meeting name, e.g. at the bottom of the slide.
- (Optional) Princeton logo and CMS logo in top corners.

Bonus points:
- If consecutive slides have very similar plots, to make toggling back/forth between slides easier, try to use image placeholders (this is supported in Google Slides and Keynote, at least) so the plots stay in the same place.
- Especially for big group meetings, it's helpful to name the `.pdf` with your name and the date.

Plotting essentials:
- Axes need to have labels and units.
