# New TauZ algorithm

## Monday Oct 7 2019
* Charged iso candidates have a Z cut in the tau producer
* 
  ```
  /hdfs/store/user/ojalvo/2019_Oct5-DYToLL_200PU_ext1-Z5-NewTauZ/
  /hdfs/store/user/ojalvo/2019_Oct5-ggHToTauTau_200PU-Z5-NewTauZ/
  Use Single Neutrino efficiency tree as pure Background: /hdfs/store/user/ojalvo/SingleNeutrino-200PU-2019_Oct5-Z5-NewTauZ-SUBPhase2/
  ```
* And add `l1TauZ` to the training. `l1TauZ` is no longer the Z of the composite tau
  (1 prong, 1prong pi0 or 3 prong's composite four vector z) but rather the z of the lead Charged Hadron's track.
* `l1TauZ` distribution is quite different for SingleNeutrino vs. ggH.
